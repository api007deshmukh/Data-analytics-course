# Choropleth map of immigration in Canada

As part of the The IBM Professional Data Analyst course, I have done this proect on presenting a visual representation depicting immigration from various countries too Canada. The data used was from UN's website (https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/data/international-migration-flows) for immigration data between 1980-2013. 

Numpy, Pandas and Folium libraries were used in thtis project. A choropleth map using a GeoJSON file of the world map was plotted with the data.
According to the attached Choropleth map final image, the countried in darket colours (red) consisted of highest immigration rates to Canada - China, India and the Phillipines.

The project demonstrates my ability to source, clean, manipulate and visualize geospatial data.
